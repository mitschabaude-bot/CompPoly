# CompPoly tests

This directory contains Lean test modules for regression and behavioral checks.

## Structure

Tests mostly mirror the `CompPoly/` hierarchy under the `CompPolyTests` namespace.
For example:

- library module: `CompPoly/Univariate/Raw.lean`
- test module: `tests/CompPolyTests/Univariate/Raw.lean`

Some tests are cross-cutting rather than one-to-one mirrors, and some mirror a
whole subtree rather than a single module (for example,
`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Binary/BF128Ghash/`).

## Running tests

Build all tests:

```bash
lake test
```

Build a single test module:

```bash
lake build CompPolyTests.Univariate.Raw
```

## Native startup and field arithmetic

`lake test` checks the Lean test modules. The separate `CompPolyNativeSmoke` executable checks
linked module initialization, AES/BF64/Ext3/GHASH arithmetic, binary-tower powers, and packed
coefficient accumulation. On Linux with GNU `timeout`, run from the repository root:

```bash
lake build --wfail CompPolyNativeSmoke && (
  set -euo pipefail
  ulimit -v 4194304
  ulimit -c 0
  LEAN_NUM_THREADS=1 timeout --kill-after=5s 30s .lake/build/bin/CompPolyNativeSmoke
)
```

The build runs normally. Execution has a 4 GiB address-space limit, a 30-second deadline, and a
five-second termination grace period. These limits cover initialization before `main`, where
accidental full-field enumeration could otherwise exhaust memory. Arithmetic mismatches, startup
failures, resource exhaustion, and timeout all fail the command.

The executable checks a wrapping BF64 product, an Ext3 reference product, addition, and inversion
including zero. AES checks cover reduction, a reference product, an inverse vector, and generic
field inversion. The AES-to-GHASH embedding checks its generator image, multiplication,
inversion and zero. GHASH checks also exercise generic field inversion/division, large natural and
integer powers, casts, and rational scalar actions, including zero and even denominators. It prints
a success message only after every check passes. This is native
implementation evidence, not a proof of the compiler or a performance benchmark. Other platforms
can build the target; running it requires equivalent platform-specific resource limits.

The tower checks pass the field dictionary to a generic helper with inlining and specialization
disabled. They cover large natural and negative integer exponents, zero bases and exponents,
and a high bit at level 7. `CompPolyTests/Fields/Binary/Tower/Powers.lean` additionally checks symbolic
operation projections and agreement with the named raw binary-power routine. These checks
establish operation and execution behavior, not compiler correctness or a performance ranking.

The packed accumulation checks compare complete 128-bit output words against concrete tower
operations. They exercise arbitrary initial accumulators, empty and cancelling sums, both limbs,
the highest bit, and the generic coefficient-evaluation entry point. A same-width BF64/tower
counterexample checks that the two field presentations remain distinct. The corresponding
`CompPolyTests/Fields/Binary/Tower/ProductAccumulation.lean` regression also checks the universal
refinement statements and coefficient ordering.

### Packed FFT native storage

`CompPolyTests/NTT/NativeStorage.lean` runs as part of `lake exe CompPolyNativeSmoke`. Its compiled comparisons exercise the inline C of the backported `ByteArray` word accessors (`CompPoly/Data/ByteArray/Pack.lean`), and the packed FFT batch stores and checked reads built on them, against independent bytewise Lean operations, including shared input preservation, allocation growth, partial batches, unaligned stores, invalid counts and near-overflow offsets. These are checks of the runtime trust boundary; FFT mathematics is covered by the kernel refinement theorems.
