# Field Extensions

`CompPoly/Fields/Extension/` is the computable field-extension framework. It models `F[X] / f`
for an **arbitrary monic modulus** `f` as a dense coefficient vector and proves it equal to
`AdjoinRoot f`, so Mathlib field theory applies to it. The parameters are `ExtensionParams` (the
modulus stored by its lower coefficients); binomials `X^d - W` keep the ergonomic front-end
`BinomialParams`, mapped in by `BinomialParams.toExtensionParams`.

This page owns extension-field architecture. Nothing in it assumes odd characteristic, and
its characteristic-two consumers include `BF64.Ext3`, the cubic extension of `GF(2^64)`, and
`AesField`, the degree-eight AES polynomial presentation over `ZMod 2` (see below). The rest
of the char-2 stack — the GHASH field, the tower fields, the additive NTT — is a separate,
independent development that predates this
framework; see [`binary-fields-and-ntt.md`](binary-fields-and-ntt.md).

## Binomials When Possible, General Moduli When Not

Most extension fields used in practice by a STARK or zkVM are binomial extensions: a
degree-2 to degree-8 extension of a 31- or 32-bit prime, defined by `X^d - W`. When a
binomial is available, prefer it — it buys two things:

- **Cheap irreducibility.** Rabin's test collapses to two exponentiations in the *base*
  field (see below).
- **Cheap multiplication.** `X^d = W` means the high half of the schoolbook product folds
  back with a single scalar multiply, with no polynomial remainder step.

But a binomial is not always available. For `d > 1`, when `gcd(d, q - 1) = 1`, the map
`x ↦ x^d` is a bijection on `F_q`, so **every** `X^d - W` has a root and is reducible.
The condition `d ∣ q - 1` suffices for the exponent-divisibility side conditions in the binomial
criterion below, but is not necessary for irreducibility in general. Over KoalaBear,
`p - 1 = 2^24 · 127`, and the degrees considered here behave as follows:

| `d` | bits | binomial? |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 124 | yes, `X^4 - 3` — but under `2^128` |
| 5 | 155 | **no**: `5 ∤ p - 1`, so `x ↦ x^5` is a bijection |
| 6 | 186 | **no**, and more strongly: `3 ∤ p - 1`, so every `W` is a cube `V^3` and `X^6 - W = (X^2 - V)(X^4 + V X^2 + V^2)` factors for *every* `W` |
| 8 | 248 | yes, but wider than needed |

Hence [`KoalaBear/Ext5.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext5.lean) adjoins a root of the
non-binomial quintic `X^5 + X^2 - 1`, and
[`KoalaBear/Ext6.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6.lean) a root of the sextic
`X^6 + X^3 + 1 = Φ₉`. The general-modulus framework and the certificate-based irreducibility
pipeline below exist to make such extensions routine.

Degree 6 is the smallest KoalaBear extension that is both comfortably above `2^128` and of
*composite* degree, so — unlike the prime-degree quintic — it has proper subfields, which is what
makes a cheap Frobenius and a norm-based inverse possible. See "Choosing a general modulus".

Import `CompPoly.Fields.Extension.Arithmetic` for raw presentations, coordinates and ring
arithmetic, including the canonical inverse candidate. The raw carrier has no algebraic
assumptions; arithmetic uses `Ring`. Import `Defs` for polynomial specifications, `Bridge`
for quotient correspondence and ring laws, or `Cardinality` for finite-coordinate facts.
`Field` requires a finite base field, a separate `Fact (Nat.card F = P.q)` certificate and
irreducibility. The binomial criterion remains in `CompPoly.Fields.Extension.Binomial`.
The `CompPoly.Fields.Extension` facade re-exports all six modules.

`Data/Polynomial/Rabin.lean` generalizes the degree-128/GF(2) specialization
`irreducible_of_rabin_128_passed_over_GF2` in `Fields/Binary/BF128Ghash/Basic.lean`, but does not
yet replace it, so there are currently **two** Rabin soundness proofs in the repo. Rebasing the
GHASH one onto `irreducible_of_rabin` is a named follow-up; until then, a fix to the argument
needs applying in both places. Note this is about the *GHASH* development specifically —
`BF64` does use the general pipeline, via the generated `Binary/BF64/BaseCertificate.lean`.

Concrete instances live next to their base field:
[`KoalaBear/Ext4.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext4.lean) (`X^4 - 3`),
[`BabyBear/Ext4.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/BabyBear/Ext4.lean) (`X^4 - 11`),
[`Hachi/Ext4.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Hachi/Ext4.lean) (`X^4 - 2`), and the non-binomial
[`KoalaBear/Ext5.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext5.lean) (`X^5 + X^2 - 1`, with its
irreducibility proof in
[`KoalaBear/Ext5/QuinticIrreducible.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext5/QuinticIrreducible.lean)
and generated certificate data in
[`KoalaBear/Ext5/QuinticCertData.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext5/QuinticCertData.lean))
and [`KoalaBear/Ext6.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6.lean) (`X^6 + X^3 + 1`, the first
*composite*-degree general modulus, with
[`Ext6/SexticIrreducible.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6/SexticIrreducible.lean) and
[`Ext6/SexticCertData.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6/SexticCertData.lean)).

### Characteristic-two consumers

[`Binary/BF64/Ext3.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Binary/BF64/Ext3.lean) adjoins a root of
`y^3 + y + 1` over `GF(2^64)`, giving `GF(2^192)`. It is the framework's first
characteristic-two instance. The selected modulus has a nonzero linear coefficient, so it uses
the *general* `ExtensionParams` path. Keeping that modulus fixes the intended polynomial-basis
presentation; `Ext ext3Params` has a coefficient vector of type `Vector BF64 3`.

Two things about it are worth knowing when reading the rest of this page:

- **The base field is not `ZMod p`.** `BF64` is a nominal carrier storing a `BitVec 64`, with carry-less
  multiplication, so the performance figures below — all measured over `ZMod` — do not
  characterise it.
- **Irreducibility needs no certificate.** A cubic is irreducible exactly when it has no root,
  and a root of `y^3 + y + 1` would satisfy `a^7 = 1`; `gcd(7, 2^64 - 1) = 1` forces `a = 1`,
  which is not a root. That is a short direct argument, not the Rabin pipeline. The *base*
  modulus of `BF64` — the degree-64 one over `GF(2)` — does use the certificate pipeline.

[`Binary/Aes/Basic.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Binary/Aes/Basic.lean) instantiates the same
framework over `ZMod 2` with `X^8 + X^4 + X^3 + X + 1`. Its byte interface is separate from
its irreducibility and field proofs; see
[the AES surface](binary-fields-and-ntt.md#aes-byte-presentation).

[`Ext6/GaloisField.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/Ext6/GaloisField.lean) is a separate
opt-in module identifying `Ext6` with Mathlib's abstract `GaloisField KoalaBear.fieldSize 6`, so
the computable arithmetic here can serve developments phrased over that (ArkLib's `KoalaSextic`,
for the Proximity Prize parameter point of [ABF26], ePrint 2026/680). `GaloisField` commits to no
modulus, so the identification follows from `card_ext6` alone and is independent of the choice of
`Φ₉` — but it is noncanonical, so it pins down nothing about where `ext6Gen` lands.

## What The Interface Provides

Concretely, for `P : ExtensionParams F` over a field `F`:

| Surface | Declarations |
|---|---|
| Ring / field | `CommRing (Ext P)`; `Field (Ext P)` additionally requires `[Finite F]`, `[Fact (Nat.card F = P.q)]`, and `[Fact (Irreducible P.poly)]` |
| Base field | `Ext.ofBase : F → Ext P`, `Ext.ofBaseRingHom`, `Algebra F (Ext P)` (hence `Module F (Ext P)` via `Algebra.toModule`) |
| Adjoined root | `Ext.gen`, `Ext.gen_pow_d : gen ^ d = monomialMod d`, `Ext.aeval_gen_poly : aeval gen P.poly = 0`; for a binomial, `Ext.gen_pow_d_binomial : gen ^ d = ofBase W` |
| Specification | `Ext.toQuot`, `Ext.ringEquivQuot : Ext P ≃+* AdjoinRoot P.poly` |
| Cardinality | `Finite (Ext P)`, optional `Fintype (Ext P)`, `Ext.nat_card_ext : Nat.card (Ext P) = q ^ d` and enumeration compatibility `Ext.card_ext` |
| Coefficients | `Ext.coeff`, `Ext.ofFn`, `Ext.equivFn : Ext P ≃ (Fin d → F)` |

With the `Algebra` instance in place, ordinary Mathlib machinery — `aeval`, scalar towers,
`Subalgebra`, `Module` — applies directly.

**Still missing**, and the natural next step: tower support. There is no `AlgebraTower` instance
(`CompPoly/Data/RingTheory/AlgebraTower.lean`), so `F ⊂ Ext F 2 ⊂ Ext F 4` does not compose and
the full Mersenne31 CM31/QM31 extension-tower stack remains unavailable.

### Mersenne31 Circle Group

The base-field circle group in
[`Mersenne31/Circle.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Mersenne31/Circle.lean) does not need that
extension tower. It provides `AddCommGroup Point`, binary natural and integer scalar
multiplication, the exact-order theorem `addOrderOf_generator`, and the additive
homomorphism `CirclePointIndex.toPointHom`. The order proof uses a kernel-checked
30-step doubling certificate to establish the half-order point, then Mathlib's
prime-power order criterion. Executable guards remain regression checks, not proof substitutes.

Regenerate the certificate declaration with
`python3 scripts/gen_mersenne31_circle_certificate.py`, or check the current declaration
with `python3 scripts/gen_mersenne31_circle_certificate.py --check`. The script is
outside the trusted code base; the kernel checks every supplied coordinate. The
[Fields module index](../../CompPoly/Fields/README.md) also links this API.

`OnCircle x y` has a computable `Decidable` instance, so concrete point fixtures can
use `by decide`. `CirclePointIndex.subgroupGen logSize h` requires a proof
`h : logSize ≤ logOrder`; out-of-range sizes are rejected instead of silently
truncating the exponent. Coset constructors pass their existing bounds to it.

`Coset` and `CircleDomain` still describe indexing shapes: arbitrary steps are allowed,
points may repeat, and a half coset may overlap its conjugate. Their `size` counts index
positions, not necessarily distinct points. The follow-up must specify validity conditions
and prove coset point distinctness, disjointness of domain halves, and the corresponding
cardinality theorems. These claims cannot be made for all current structure values.

## Irreducibility: Rabin, Collapsed

Rabin's test says a degree-`d` polynomial `f` over `F_q` is irreducible exactly when
`f ∣ X^(q^d) - X` and `f` is coprime to `X^(q^(d/l)) - X` for every prime `l ∣ d`.

For a binomial, `X^d = W` gives `X^(q^j) ≡ W^((q^j - 1)/d) * X (mod X^d - W)` whenever
`d ∣ q^j - 1`. Both conditions therefore become conditions on `W` alone:

> `X^d - W` is irreducible over `F_q` **iff** `W^((q^d - 1)/d) = 1` and
> `W^((q^(d/l) - 1)/d) ≠ 1` for every prime `l ∣ d`.

For `d = 4` that is two exponentiations, discharged by `reduce_mod_char`, which does modular
repeated squaring during elaboration.

Nothing here uses `native_decide`, per the TCB policy in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

## Irreducibility: Rabin, Certified (Non-Binomial Moduli)

For a non-binomial modulus nothing collapses, and the Rabin conditions are genuine
`F[X]` statements: `f ∣ X^(q^d) - X` needs `X^(q^d) mod f`, about `d · log₂ q` modular
squarings. [`Data/Polynomial/RabinCertificate.lean`](../../CompPoly/Data/Polynomial/RabinCertificate.lean)
handles this with kernel-checked certificates:

- Polynomials are little-endian `ℕ`-coefficient lists with schoolbook arithmetic by
  structural recursion, so checks reduce in the kernel via GMP-accelerated `Nat` ops.
- A whole square-and-multiply chain is **one list literal** verified by a single kernel
  reduction of `runChain`; `runChain_sound` lifts it to `X^N % f = r % f`.
- The trace condition is a chain ending at `X`; coprimality is a chain plus a Bézout
  identity `u·f + v·w = 1` on the reduced residue — no Euclidean gcd chain.
- `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree` packages the test when `d` is prime (one trace, one
  coprimality check).

**Composite degree needs one coprimality check per prime factor**, and the prime-degree collapse
is *unsound* there rather than merely weak. `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin` already quantifies
over `d.primeFactors`; the packaged forms are:

| `d` | Wrapper | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| prime | `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree` | `f ∣ X^(q^d) - X`, `IsCoprime f (X^q - X)` |
| `ℓ ^ k` | `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_power` | `f ∣ X^(q^d) - X`, `IsCoprime f (X^(q^(d/ℓ)) - X)`; `d = ℓ^k` supplied by the caller |
| `6` | `irreducible_of_rabin_degree_six` | plus `IsCoprime f (X^(q^3) - X)` and `IsCoprime f (X^(q^2) - X)` |
| two prime factors | `irreducible_of_rabin_two_prime_factors` | as above, `Nat.primeFactors d = {ℓ₁, ℓ₂}` supplied by the caller |

The prime-power row covers `4`, `8`, `16`, `64` and `128` — every binary-field degree in the
repo and most binomial ones — and is why `Aes.modulus` (`d = 8`) and `BF64.basePoly` (`d = 64`)
no longer carry their own `Nat.primeFactors` lemma. At three or more distinct prime factors
there is no wrapper yet; call `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin` and discharge the
`d.primeFactors` quantifier at the call site.

Every one of them takes the field size as a numeral, described next.

Concretely, over KoalaBear `(X^3 + X + 4)(X^3 + X - 4)` divides `X^(p^6) - X` and is coprime to
`X^p - X`, so it satisfies the prime-degree conditions verbatim while being visibly reducible;
only the `q^3` check rejects it. `Nat.primeFactors 6 = {2, 3}` cannot be closed by `decide`
(`Nat.primeFactorsList` is well-founded recursive and does not reduce in the kernel), so it is
proved via `Nat.primeFactors_mul`, mirroring `primeFactors_four` in `Extension/Binomial.lean`.

The generator loops over the prime factors too, and the same trap applied to it: before that fix
it reported the product above as irreducible and exited `0`. Its `--self-test` flag now checks it
against known-answer cases including that polynomial.

Certificate data is emitted by the untrusted generator
[`scripts/gen_rabin_certificate.py`](../../scripts/gen_rabin_certificate.py)
(`--lean`/`--namespace` produce a complete data module); the kernel re-checks every step.
The KoalaBear quintic instance costs ~290 generated lines and compiles in about two
seconds — contrast the roughly 2100 lines of per-step `BitVec` certificates the same test
costs the GHASH polynomial (`Fields/Binary/BF128Ghash/XPowTwoPow{Mod,Gcd}Certificate.lean`),
which predates this framework.

### The Field Size Enters As A Numeral

Every criterion that depends on a field size takes it as a numeral `q` together with
`hcard : Fintype.card F = q`, and substitutes it away internally. There is exactly one form of
each statement:

| Criterion | File |
|---|---|
| `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin`, `rabin_of_irreducible`, `irreducible_iff_rabin` | `Data/Polynomial/Rabin.lean` |
| `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree`, `..._prime_power`, `..._two_prime_factors`, `..._degree_six` | `Data/Polynomial/RabinCertificate.lean` |
| `Polynomial.irreducible_X_pow_sub_C{,_iff}`, `irreducible_X_pow_four_sub_C{,_iff}` | `Fields/Extension/Binomial.lean` |
| `Polynomial.irreducible_dvd_X_pow_sub_X_iff_natDegree_dvd`, and `..._add_X_...` for characteristic two | `Data/Polynomial/Frobenius.lean` |

Both kinds of caller are served by the one form:

- **A concrete field** supplies `hcard` as `ZMod.card _` (or its own cardinality lemma, such as
  `card_bf64`) and states its conditions at the numeral its certificates were generated for. A
  concrete field is `ZMod fieldSize` with `fieldSize` an *expression* like `2 ^ 31 - 2 ^ 24 + 1`,
  so this is also what lets `norm_num` and `reduce_mod_char` discharge the side conditions: both
  need the modulus as a literal.
- **An abstract caller** passes `rfl` and gets the `Fintype.card F` statement back verbatim. The
  `q`-parameterized statement is the same theorem, universally quantified over the spelling of the
  size, so nothing is lost; `Extension/Binomial.lean` calls the Rabin layer exactly this way.

**Why there is no `Fintype.card F`-only variant.** Such a variant forces a concrete caller to cast
each condition with `rw [hcard]`, which leaves an `Eq.mpr` transport wrapped around a certificate
whose type carries a huge exponent (`X ^ (fieldSize ^ 6)`). A kernel replay from an empty
environment checks a serialized and reconstructed expression graph and need not follow the
normalization path that checking the elaborator's in-memory term took; one such transport has been
observed to send the kernel into `Polynomial.pow → npowRec → Nat.rec`, unfolding the power one
exponent step at a time until the deep-recursion guard fired. With a single
numeral-parameterized form, that cast has no occasion to appear — for us, or for a downstream
author writing their own extension, who is covered by no linter of ours.

The `_of_card` spellings that v4.33.1 and v4.34.0 shipped
(`irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree_of_card`, `irreducible_of_rabin_degree_six_of_card`,
`irreducible_X_pow_four_sub_C_of_card` and `..._iff_of_card`) survive as deprecated aliases of
the names above, with identical statements, so existing callers keep working with a warning.

History: PR #306 introduced parallel `_of_card` wrappers for the two KoalaBear certificates and
misattributed the cost to reducing `Fintype.card (ZMod p)` itself; #307 corrected the rationale;
#308 recorded the mechanism above; #369 collapsed the two parallel surfaces into the single form
documented here.

**The same shape, one level down.** Rewriting *at a hypothesis* whose type carries a large
exponent — `rw [CharTwo.sub_eq_add] at h` where `h : q ∣ X ^ 2 ^ 128 + X` — has the same problem
and the same fix: absorb the rewrite into a statement generic in the exponent, as
`irreducible_dvd_X_pow_add_X_iff_natDegree_dvd` does for the characteristic-two spelling, so the
concrete caller only ever applies a term. `BF128Ghash` uses it in both directions for exactly
that reason.

Passing `rfl` to recover the `Fintype.card F` statement is pinned as a regression test in
`tests/CompPolyTests/Data/Polynomial/{Rabin,RabinCertificate,Frobenius}.lean` and
`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Binomial.lean`, so a later edit cannot quietly add a
hypothesis or shift an exponent.

### Choosing a general modulus

Since every irreducible `f` of degree `d` gives the same field up to isomorphism, the choice is
purely about arithmetic cost, and it is decided by two tables: the reduction table
`X^d … X^(2d-2) mod f` that `Ext.red` holds, and the Frobenius matrix. Entries of `±1` cost an
add or a negation; anything else costs a base-field multiplication. Measured over the irreducible
sextics of KoalaBear:

| modulus | red-table nonzeros | needing a multiply | Frobenius nonzeros | needing a multiply |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `X^6 + X^3 + 1` (`Φ₉`) | 8 | **0** | 8 | **0** |
| `X^6 - X^3 + 1` (`Φ₁₈`) | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| `X^6 - 2X^3 - 2` | 10 | 10 | 11 | 9 |
| `X^6 + 4X - 3` | 10 | 10 | 31 | 30 |
| `X^6 + 3X^2 - 3` | 11 | 11 | 16 | 15 |
| `X^6 + X^4 + 3` | 13 | 9 | 16 | 15 |

So prefer, in order: a cyclotomic `Φₙ` when one has the right degree; then a sparse trinomial with
`±1` coefficients; then anything sparse. Two further points, both visible above:

- A modulus of the form `g(X^k)` puts a subfield at `F_p(θ^k)` with a sparse coordinate
  description, i.e. it *is* a tower in disguise. `Φ₉ = g(X^3)` with `g = Y^2 + Y + 1` gives
  `F_p ⊂ F_p² ⊂ F_p⁶`, so the tower's arithmetic is available without any tower machinery. The
  mirror orientation `h(X^2)` with `h` cubic is `X^6 + X^4 + 3` — the same idea, measurably worse.
- Prefer all-nonnegative coefficients when there is a choice: the certificate encoding then needs
  no `p - 1` literal, and no `cast_p_sub_one`-style lemma. Compare `sexticL = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1]`
  against `quinticL = [2130706432, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`.

### Adding a new binomial extension

1. Pick `W`. For `d = 4` over `q ≡ 1 mod 4`, any non-square works; prefer the smallest, so
   that multiplying by `W` is cheap.
2. Write the raw `BinomialParams`, including literal `q`, and separately provide
   `instance : Fact (Nat.card Field = params.q)`. For `ZMod`, rewrite
   `Nat.card_eq_fintype_card` and use `ZMod.card _`. The cardinality certificate is forwarded
   to `params.toExtensionParams`.
3. Prove irreducibility with `irreducible_X_pow_four_sub_C`, or `irreducible_X_pow_sub_C` at a
   degree other than `4` (it takes the conditions quantified over `d.primeFactors`), passing
   `hcard` as `ZMod.card _`. The exponentiation goals need the type presented as
   `ZMod <numeral>`, because `reduce_mod_char` reads the modulus syntactically and `fieldSize` is
   an expression like `2 ^ 31 - 2 ^ 24 + 1`. Use a `show` — see any of the three `Ext4.lean`
   files.
4. Register `instance : Fact (Irreducible ...)`, define the `abbrev` as
   `Ext ...Params.toExtensionParams`, and route the `Fact` through `toExtensionParams_poly` — see
   `KoalaBear/Ext4.lean`.
5. Serialization comes for free: `Ext P` over any base with a `ByteCodec` is its coefficient
   vector, `P.d * width` bytes (`Extension/Bytes.lean`). Add a `#guard` with one byte vector to
   the mirrored test module and nothing else. A new *carrier* is different — see the note
   after the next checklist.

That is about 60 lines.

### Adding a new non-binomial extension

1. Pick a monic irreducible `f` (confirm with `scripts/gen_rabin_certificate.py`, which
   exits nonzero if `f` is reducible).
2. Generate the certificate module:
   `python3 scripts/gen_rabin_certificate.py --p <p> --f=<coeffs> --lean <path> --namespace <NS>`.
3. Write the irreducibility wrapper: `toPoly p fL = f`, `natDegree`, `f ≠ 0`, then the
   chain/Bézout `rfl` checks and the assembly through
   `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_degree` (prime `d`, see
   `KoalaBear/Ext5/QuinticIrreducible.lean`) or `irreducible_of_rabin_degree_six`
   (composite `d`, see `KoalaBear/Ext6/SexticIrreducible.lean`), passing
   `hcard : Fintype.card Field = fieldSize := ZMod.card _`. At another composite `d`, use
   `irreducible_of_rabin_prime_power` when `d = ℓ ^ k` — as `BF64.basePoly_irreducible`
   does at `d = 64` — `irreducible_of_rabin_two_prime_factors` at two distinct prime
   factors, or `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin` beyond that. Each condition then applies
   directly; if you find yourself writing `rw [hcard]` to make one fit, see "The Field Size
   Enters As A Numeral". At composite `d` there is one
   chain plus Bézout block per prime factor, named `cop<m>Steps`/`cop<m>Rp`/… for `m = d / ℓ`.
4. Write the `ExtensionParams` (lower coefficients of `f`, little-endian) and prove
   `...Params.poly = f`; register the `Fact` and define the `abbrev` — see
   `KoalaBear/Ext5.lean` (supporting cert/proof files under `KoalaBear/Ext5/`).
5. Serialization comes for free, as for a binomial extension; add the one `#guard`.

That is the generated data plus about 200 hand-written lines.

A new **carrier** does not get its codec for free: a Montgomery-backed `Ext`, or a fast prime
field for a new base, must add `CanonicalNat`/`ByteCodec` instances and prove it encodes
identically to the spec field (`toBytes (ofField x) = toBytes x`), as
`Montgomery/Native32Bytes.lean` does. The rule and the checklist are in
[`serialization.md`](serialization.md) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("New Types Owe a Codec").

## Representation And Computability

`Ext P` retains `P` in a structure with a `Vector F P.d` coefficient field: dense,
little-endian, length exactly `d`. The inverse maps `Ext.coeffs` and `Ext.ofVector`
provide explicit access to this representation. There is no degree-bound
invariant to maintain — the bound is *structural*, a consequence of the length, not a proposition
carried alongside the data. As a result this subtree is **independent of the `CPolynomial`
stack**: nothing under `CompPoly/Fields/Extension/` imports `CompPoly/Univariate/`.

The one place a degree bound is needed on the *polynomial* side — showing that the representative
`Ext.toQuot` picks is the canonical degree-`< d` one — is proved directly in
[`Extension/Bridge.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Extension/Bridge.lean) as `degree_repr_lt`, from
`Polynomial.degree_sum_le` and `Polynomial.degree_C_mul_X_pow_le`. If you want the
`CPolynomial`-side theory instead (`degreeLT`, `degreeLTEquiv` in
[`Univariate/Linear.lean`](../../CompPoly/Univariate/Linear.lean) and
[`Univariate/ToPoly/Degree.lean`](../../CompPoly/Univariate/ToPoly/Degree.lean)), it exists but is
**not** wired to this framework; connecting them would be new work.

`ExtensionParams` carries `d`, the modulus's lower coefficients, and a proposed base cardinality
`q` as a *type index*. With fixed operations on the coefficient type, different parameter
values give different presentation types. The raw carrier does not choose between multiple
ring dictionaries on the same coefficient type. `q` is data rather than `Fintype.card F` because Fermat
inversion evaluates the exponent at runtime, and `Fintype.card (ZMod p)` would enumerate all
of `Fin p`. `BinomialParams` is the ergonomic front-end for `X^d - W`, mapped in by
`BinomialParams.toExtensionParams` (lower coefficients `(-W, 0, …, 0)`), with `toExtensionParams_poly`
identifying the two spellings of the defining polynomial.

Cardinality correctness is separate from the raw parameters: field laws require `Finite F`
and `Fact (Nat.card F = P.q)`, both propositions. `Ext.inv` always evaluates the stored
exponent, even for an incorrect `q`; without the certificates it is only an inverse candidate.
For example, `q = 0` gives `0⁻¹ = 1`. The cardinality and field proofs create enumerations
locally when needed; no enumeration dictionary is passed to raw operations or the field
instance. `Ext.nat_card_ext` and the proof-only `Finite (Ext P)` instance support subsequent
certified extensions without requiring an executable enumeration.

The raw and certificate boundaries are exercised in
[`RawArithmetic.lean`](../../tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/RawArithmetic.lean) and
[`Certificates.lean`](../../tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Certificates.lean), including
an infinite coefficient ring, incorrect cardinality, and an infinite field with irreducible
modulus and true cardinality zero.

**The instances are assembled field-by-field, not by `Function.Injective.commRing` /
`.field`.** Those transports take `toQuot` as data, which forces the resulting instance
`noncomputable`. That is not merely cosmetic: `Monoid.toNatPow` then outranks `Ext.instPow`, and
compiled `x ^ n` fails to build. This was observed, not hypothesized. If you add structure to
`Ext P`, keep it computable and keep a `#guard` in
[`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Arithmetic.lean`](../../tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Arithmetic.lean)
that exercises the operation, since only compiled evaluation catches this class of regression.

The load-bearing correctness lemma is `Ext.toQuot_shiftReduce`: `shiftReduce` is "multiply by
`X`, reduce mod `f`", and `toQuot (shiftReduce e) = rt * toQuot e` is the one place the
defining relation `rt_relation` is consumed. `monomialMod k = shiftReduce^[k] 1` is then
`X^k mod f` by a one-line induction, and `toQuot_mul` — `Ext.mul` expands product monomials
through `monomialMod` — follows with no wrap-around case analysis at all.

## Performance: Measured, And Not Yet Competitive

The framework is correctness-complete, and its *design* is ready for fast arithmetic — `Ext P`
is generic over the base-field carrier precisely so a Montgomery representation can be dropped
in. The current instantiation over `ZMod`, however, is **not** fast. Measured with
`lake exe CompPolyBench --small` on a developer laptop:

| Group | Operation | Average |
|---|---|---|
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext4-mul` | `mul` | ~25 us |
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext4-inv` | `inv` | ~3.5 ms |
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext5-mul` | `mul` | ~41 us |
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext5-inv` | `inv` | ~7.6 ms |
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext6-mul` | `mul` | ~64 us |
| `fields-extension-koalabear-ext6-inv` | `inv` | ~15 ms |

For scale, a hand-written Rust degree-4 BabyBear multiply is a few nanoseconds. Do not quote
this framework as performance-ready until the items below are done.

Those numbers are with the reduction table in place. The same benchmarks with `@[csimp]` removed
from `mul_eq_mulTbl`, i.e. running the specification directly, on the same machine:

| Operation | Spec (`mul`) | Table (`mulTbl`) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ext4 `mul` | 78.1 us | 25.4 us | 3.1x |
| Ext4 `inv` | 14.0 ms | 3.5 ms | 4.0x |
| Ext5 `mul` | 195.6 us | 40.6 us | 4.8x |
| Ext6 `mul` | 429.8 us | 63.8 us | 6.7x |
| Ext6 `inv` | 119.6 ms | 15.1 ms | 7.9x |

The speedup growing with `d` is the point: it is the `O(d^5) → O(d^3)` change becoming visible.
The 78 us spec figure also reproduces the ~73 us recorded before the table existed, which is what
makes this an honest A/B rather than a change of measurement conditions.

The remaining causes, in order of size:

1. **`Ext.mul` allocates, and its asymptotics are still not optimal.**

   *Asymptotics.* `mul` — the specification — expands each product monomial through
   `monomialMod (i + j) = shiftReduce^[i+j] 1`, recomputed for every `(m, i, j)`. That is what
   keeps the correctness proof one additive lemma, and what made the compiled code roughly
   O(d⁵). `Ext.red` now holds `X^0 … X^(2d-2) mod f`, and `Ext.mulTbl` consults it instead;
   `mul_eq_mulTbl` is registered `@[csimp]`, so compilation is swapped while every proof still
   refers to `Ext.mul`. That is O(d³). The remaining step to O(d²) is a schoolbook convolution
   to length `2d - 1` folded through `red`, rather than the current triple sum, plus hoisting
   `red` out of `mulTbl` so it is computed once per `P` rather than once per multiplication.

   *Allocation.* Because `P` is a runtime parameter nothing monomorphises: `Finset.univ` is
   rebuilt and `Fin` values boxed on every call. `@[specialize]` recovers only about 6%. The fix
   is an `Array`-loop backend, following the `MulContext` idiom in
   [`Univariate/Context.lean`](../../CompPoly/Univariate/Context.lean).

   Keep the `monomialMod` expansion as the *spec* whatever replaces `mulTbl`: it is what
   `toQuot_mul` is proved against, and reducing everything to `toQuot_shiftReduce` is why that
   proof is short.
2. **The base field is `ZMod p`**, i.e. boxed `Nat` arithmetic. Instantiating over
   `KoalaBear.Fast.Field` (`UInt32` Montgomery,
   [`Montgomery/Native32Field.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/Montgomery/Native32Field.lean))
   needs `Finite` and a certified `Nat.card` for that carrier, plus irreducibility transported along
   `Montgomery.Native32.ringEquiv` with `Polynomial.mapEquiv`. No change to the framework.
3. **Inversion is Fermat** (`x ^ (q^d - 2)`), about `d · log q` extension multiplications — the
   ~140x ratio to `mul` above, and it is the reason the `#guard` regressions dominate the test
   module's build time. A norm-based inverse (Itoh–Tsujii) would be roughly two orders of
   magnitude faster: `N(x) = ∏_j φ^j(x)` lands in the base field, so
   `x⁻¹ = (∏_{j≥1} φ^j(x)) · N(x)⁻¹` costs `d - 1` Frobenius applications, `d - 1` extension
   multiplications, and one base-field inverse.

   The cost hinges on Frobenius being sparse, which is exactly what the modulus choice above
   buys. For a binomial with `d ∣ q - 1` it is a coordinate-wise scaling by powers of
   `W^((q-1)/d)`; for `Ext6` it is `θ ↦ θ^2` with all-`±1` entries, since `p ≡ 2 mod 9`. Neither
   `Ext.frobenius` nor `Ext.norm` exists yet.

None of these is hidden behind an abstraction that makes replacing it awkward, and each is
guarded by the `#guard` regressions in
[`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Arithmetic.lean`](../../tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/Extension/Arithmetic.lean).

### Fast KoalaBear quartic extension (2026-10-07)

`KoalaBear.Fast.Ext4` ([`KoalaBear/FastExt4.lean`](../../CompPoly/Fields/KoalaBear/FastExt4.lean)) is `KoalaBear[X] / (X^4 - 3)` as a structure of four Montgomery coefficients, outside the generic `Ext` framework: a second `Mul` instance on `Ext P` over the fast carrier would make a diamond, and `@[csimp]` cannot specialize `Ext.mul` to one `P`. `toSpec` maps it into the spec `KoalaBear.Ext4`, `specEquiv` is the ring isomorphism, and `toSpec_add`, `toSpec_mul`, `toSpec_inv`, `toSpec_div` and `toSpec_ofBase` give agreement operation by operation. Its byte codec is the four coefficient encodings, identical to the spec field's (`toBytes_toSpec`).

* Multiplication folds `3` into the left factors, so every output coefficient is a sum of four products, which `Montgomery.Native32.mulAdd4` reduces once: four products stay below `2 · p · 2^32` for every modulus below `2^31`, so one conditional subtraction of `p · 2^32` brings the sum into `reduce`'s range.
* Inversion is the norm-based inverse from item 3 above, specialized to the binomial: with `σ : X ↦ -X`, `a · σ(a) = g₀ + g₁ X²` lies in `F(X²)`, and `a⁻¹ = σ(a) (g₀ - g₁ X²) / (g₀² - 3 g₁²)` needs one base-field inversion. That the norm of a nonzero element is nonzero follows from `σ` being an injective ring endomorphism of the quotient field and from `3` being a quadratic non-residue (`three_not_square`, by `reduce_mod_char`).

Known answers from Plonky3's `BinomialExtensionField<KoalaBear, 4>` are checked in [`tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/KoalaBear/FastExt4.lean`](../../tests/CompPolyTests/Fields/KoalaBear/FastExt4.lean). The `fields-extension-koalabear-ext4-mul` and `-inv` benchmark groups time both types on the same operands and cross-check their checksums. On the eight-core Ryzen server, one record per call including the harness's operand lookup and the result allocation: multiplication 7.3 µs (spec) and 28 ns (fast), inversion 913 µs (spec, Fermat) and 161 ns (fast, norm).

## Base Field Caveats

`Hachi` (`2^32 - 99`) has no `FastField` Montgomery path: `Mont32Field` requires
`modulus < 2^31`, since radix-`2^32` reduction needs `x + m * p < 2^64`. It also has two-adicity
2, so it admits no radix-2 NTT domain. The extension layer is generic over the base-field
carrier, so a future 64-bit Montgomery layer would be picked up unchanged.
