# Scripts

This directory contains the main helper scripts for local validation and CI support.

## Recommended Entry Points

- `./scripts/update-lib.sh` - regenerate `CompPoly.lean` from tracked source files.
- `./scripts/check-imports.sh` - verify that `CompPoly.lean` is up to date.
- `./scripts/lint-style.sh` - run the Lean style linter and repo-wide Lean-file
  checks.
- `python3 ./scripts/check-docs-integrity.py` - verify the `CLAUDE.md` symlink,
  local markdown links, and backticked source paths across the handbook.
- `lake exe axiomsweep --check` - kernel-level axiom/`sorry` regression gate against
  `scripts/axiom_baseline.json` (run after `lake build`).
- `./scripts/bench-ab.sh run <group>` - A/B the current build against a frozen
  baseline on one benchmark group and print a verdict per row.

## Script Inventory

### `AxiomSweep.lean` (`lake exe axiomsweep`)

Kernel-level axiom/`sorry` accounting for every reportable `CompPoly.*` declaration,
computed from the built `.olean` environment, with a committed regression baseline
(`axiom_baseline.json`). `--check` fails only on new taint; `--update-baseline`
refreshes the baseline; `--out FILE` writes a full per-declaration report. Bare and
generated native-compiler trust is rejected regardless of the baseline. See the module
docstring for modes and known blind spots.

### `update-lib.sh`

Regenerates [`../CompPoly.lean`](../CompPoly.lean) by scanning tracked
`CompPoly/**/*.lean` files. Run this after adding, renaming, or deleting source
files under `CompPoly/`.

### `check-imports.sh`

Runs `update-lib.sh`, compares the result with the committed `CompPoly.lean`, and
fails if the generated umbrella import file is stale.

Use this when:

- you changed the source tree layout,
- CI reports that imports are out of date,
- you want a quick check before pushing.

### `lint-style.sh`

Runs the Lean style linter across the repository and then performs a few repo-wide
checks such as executable-bit detection and filename collisions.

This is the higher-level wrapper around `lint-style.py`.

### `lint-style.py`

The underlying Python linter for Lean style issues. It checks module docstrings,
line length, forbidden imports or tactics, trailing whitespace, and the local
`native_decide` policy, while honoring entries in `style-exceptions.txt`.

Use this directly only when you want to lint a specific subset of files.

### `gen_mersenne31_circle_certificate.py`

Emits the `generatorDoublings` declaration for the Mersenne31 circle generator by
30 successive doublings modulo `2^31 - 1`. It prints the declaration without modifying
source files. Run `python3 scripts/gen_mersenne31_circle_certificate.py --check` to
verify the checked-in data, or pass a Lean file after `--check` to compare that file.
The script is outside the trusted code base: Lean checks every step with kernel
`decide` and proves the connection to scalar multiplication. See the
[circle-group documentation](../docs/wiki/field-extensions.md#mersenne31-circle-group).

### `gen_rabin_certificate.py`

TCB-external generator for kernel-checkable Rabin irreducibility certificates of a
monic polynomial `f` over a prime field `F_p`. Computes the repeated-squaring steps
for `X^(p^d) mod f` (the trace condition) and, for each prime factor `l` of
`d = deg f`, the steps for `X^(p^(d/l)) mod f` plus a Bezout pair witnessing
`gcd(f, X^(p^(d/l)) - X) = 1` (the coprimality conditions). Emits them as JSON, and
with `--lean` as a complete compilable Lean module. Nothing it produces is trusted:
the Lean side re-checks every step in the kernel via `rfl`.

The per-prime-factor loop matters at composite `d`: checking only the linear-factor
case `gcd(f, X^p - X)` admits a product of equal-degree factors, so a product of two
irreducible cubics would be reported irreducible at `d = 6`.

Parameterized by `--p` and `--f` (little-endian monic coefficients); defaults to
KoalaBear with `f = x^5 + x^2 - 1`. Used to build the degree-5 and degree-6 KoalaBear
extensions. The exit code is the verdict — non-zero means `f` is reducible — so the
script doubles as a checker.

Run `python3 scripts/gen_rabin_certificate.py --self-test` to check the generator
against known-answer cases, including a reducible sextic that the prime-degree form of
the test would wrongly accept.

### `check-docs-integrity.py`

Three checks over every tracked `.md` file:

1. `CLAUDE.md` exists and is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.
2. Local markdown links resolve.
3. Backticked source paths — `` `CompPoly/Univariate/Basic.lean` `` and friends,
   with extensions `.lean`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.yml`, `.bib` — point at files that
   exist.

The third check is the one that catches module splits and renames, since the docs
cite far more paths in backticks than in markdown links. Bare filenames with no
directory, glob patterns, and paths ending in `/` are skipped as prose. Paths may
be written relative to the repo root, to the citing file's directory, or to one of
the subtree roots in `PATH_PREFIXES` — so a page about `Fields/` may write
`KoalaBear/Ext4.lean`. Adding a prefix weakens the check; prefer fixing the doc.

### `build_timing_report.sh`

Helper used by CI to measure and render build timings. Labels:

- `warm_rebuild` — default library gate: `lake build` with cached oleans
  (incremental; only dirty modules rebuild).
- `test_path` — `lake test`.
- `clean_build` — `rm -rf .lake/build && lake build`, when Lean Action CI
  detects a `lean-toolchain` or `lake-manifest.json` change vs the comparison
  base, or when the workflow is run manually with the `clean_build` input.

The CI workflow uploads timing-data artifacts so PR runs can compare against a
previously recorded baseline without rerunning that baseline in the same job.
This supports
[`../.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml).

### `bench-ab.sh`

Driver for the optimisation loop in
[`../docs/wiki/autoresearch.md`](../docs/wiki/autoresearch.md). Three
subcommands:

- `freeze [--force]` builds `CompPolyBench` and keeps a copy under
  `bench/out/ab/baseline/` together with the commit it came from.
- `run <group>[,<group>...]` builds the current tree once, then runs the frozen
  baseline and the fresh binary alternately (`BENCH_AB_ROUNDS`, default 5, at
  `BENCH_AB_PRESET`, default `medium`) on the given groups plus the harness
  self-check, each invocation into its own `--out-dir`, and finishes with
  `CompPolyBench --compare`. Its exit code is the compare command's.
- `clean [--all]` removes comparison runs under `bench/out/ab/`.

Use this when:

- you changed a fast implementation and want to know whether it got faster,
- you want a same-machine number rather than one compared against yesterday's,
- an agent is iterating on a kernel and needs a keep-or-revert signal.

Everything it writes is under `bench/out/`, which is ignored. It never runs
`lake exe` once measurement has started, so a rebuild cannot race a run.

## Typical Workflows

### Optimising a fast kernel

```bash
./scripts/bench-ab.sh freeze
# edit one kernel
lake build
lake exe CompPolyBench --validate-only --groups fields-koalabear-mul
./scripts/bench-ab.sh run fields-koalabear-mul
```

### Added or renamed source files

```bash
./scripts/update-lib.sh
./scripts/check-imports.sh
lake build
```

### Lean-heavy cleanup

```bash
./scripts/lint-style.sh
lake build
```

### Docs-only change

```bash
python3 ./scripts/check-docs-integrity.py
```

### Rust field comparison

`python3 scripts/bench-fields.py --suite all --cpu 0` checks Lean/Rust agreement and writes compact comparison tables plus raw samples under `bench/out/`. Select `small-prime`, `large-prime`, `binary`, `ntt`, `interpolate`, or `all`; the default is `small-prime`. Use `--validate-only` for correctness checks and `--skip-build` to reuse a verified build from a previous driver run. The `ntt` suite uses `--cpus` for a configurable worker budget (default: all physical cores, up to sixteen, without SMT siblings) in its KoalaBear transform comparison against optimized parallel Plonky3; `--cpu` selects one worker; `scripts/bench_ntt.py` implements it with the same build verification. The `interpolate` suite compares coset interpolation at an extension point against Plonky3's `interpolate_coset`, with the same worker selection; `scripts/bench_interpolate.py` implements it. See [the benchmark README](../bench/README.md#rust-field-comparison).
